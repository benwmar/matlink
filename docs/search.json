    "text": "Introduction\nThe goals of OMOP are to gain better understanding of human health by improving our ability to analyze observational health data.\nHealth data is stored by individual health systems in unique ways which limits the ability to collaborate and learn from larger populations. This is a problem because certain clinical conditions are infrequent and it is important to have sufficient number of cases to perform statistical tests. De-identified data shared across institutions has the promise of allowing scientists to develop important insights about health which is the motivation to enable greater collaboration.\n\nWhat is a common data model?\nA common data model (CDM) allows multiple health care systems with their individual databases to join forces creating greater populations which can power more compelling scientific studies. A simple way to think about this is the difficulty of finding the silverware drawer in a new kitchen – if there is a unifying rule for where the silverware drawer is located in every kitchen (immediately to right of the sink) it makes it possible to find this much easier. A common data model creates a system so that data elements like “systolic blood pressure” or “sepsis” are recorded and organized in the same way. OMOP stands for Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership and is the common data model of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics program.\n\n\nWhat is an ETL?\nETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. Essentially this is the process of mapping data from one system to another. Please see [The Book of OHDSI, Chapter 6] (https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/ExtractTransformLoad.html)."

The four columns can also be interpreted as the median for the bottom 50% (percentile_25), overall median (median), median for the top 50% (percentile_75), and the median for the top 10% (percentile_95) – in terms of how many times the measurement was taken for each patient in the cohort.\n\n\n\nProfile_script_7B\n\n\n\n\n07_C_drug_exposure_profile.sql\nGenerates a table of all drugs given in the cohort.\nExample Interpretation\nThe highlighted row shows that acetaminophen was administered to 7,937 total patients which represents 68% of the patients in the cohort.

    "section": "OMOP Table and Field Basics",
    "text": "OMOP Table and Field Basics\nAdapted from OHDSI CDM Site: Data Model Conventions\n\nTables\nFor the tables of the main domains of the CDM it is imperative that concepts used are strictly limited to the domain. For example, the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table contains only information about conditions (diagnoses, signs, symptoms), but no information about procedures. Not all source coding schemes adhere to such rules. For example, ICD-9-CM codes, which contain mostly diagnoses of human disease, also contain information about the status of patients having received a procedure. The ICD-9-CM code V20.3 ‘Newborn health supervision’ defines a continuous procedure and is therefore stored in the PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE table.\n\n\nFields\nVariable names across all tables follow one convention:\n\n\n\nNotation\nDescription\n\n\n_SOURCE_VALUE\nVerbatim information from the source data, typically used in ETL to map to CONCEPT_ID, and not to be used by any standard analytics. For example, CONDITION_SOURCE_VALUE = ‘787.02’ was the ICD-9 code captured as a diagnosis from the administrative claim.\n\n\n_ID\nUnique identifiers for key entities, which can serve as foreign keys to establish relationships across entities. For example, PERSON_ID uniquely identifies each individual. VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID uniquely identifies a PERSON encounter at a point of care.\n\n\n_CONCEPT_ID\nForeign key into the Standardized Vocabularies (i.e. the standard_concept attribute for the corresponding term is true), which serves as the primary basis for all standardized analytics. For example, CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID = 31967 contains the reference value for the SNOMED concept of ‘Nausea’\n\n\n_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID\nForeign key into the Standardized Vocabularies representing the concept and terminology used in the source data, when applicable. For example, CONDITION_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID = 45431665 denotes the concept of ‘Nausea’ in the Read terminology; the analogous CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID might be 31967, since SNOMED-CT is the Standardized Vocabulary for most clinical diagnoses and findings.\n\n\n_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID\nDelineates the origin of the source information, standardized within the Standardized Vocabularies. For example, DRUG_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID can allow analysts to discriminate between ‘Pharmacy dispensing’ and ’Prescription written\n\n\n\nFor more information, see:\nData Model Conventions\nHow to Calculate Drug Dose\nClinical Data Tables"

    "text": "From University of Colorado, below are excellent REDCap resources: University of Colorado REDCap Resources\n\n\n\nWhy is the Participant ID the first field in the project? When you set up a REDCap database your record identifier e.g. Participant ID must be the first field on the first form so that REDCap will link all following data on all forms for that record. There is no need to repeat the record identifier in each form.\nHow do I code categorical variables? If your categorical variable has numeric response options be sure to assign a value that is the same number to avoid confusion in analysis. For example if the question is “How many times did you ….” and the options are 0,1,2,3,4,5 you should assign values of 0-5 (note: you cannot use the auto-assign feature of REDCap because it will start with 1).\nWhen should I use the dropdown field type? Use dropdown field types instead of radio buttons for categorical variables on your data entry forms. REDCap allows you to type the first character of a label to select that option in a dropdown which is much easier than having to individually select each radio button with your mouse.\nHow do I tell the difference between a radio and checkbox field? There is a visual cue to tell you whether a field is a radio button (single option) or a checkbox (choose all that apply). Radio buttons are round, checkboxes are square.\nHow do I format branching logic or a calculation with checkbox fields? Checkbox or “choose all that apply” fields are coded slightly differently from other categorical fields such as radio or dropdown. In those each option is set to equal a unique value e.g. 1=red, 2=blue, 3=green. Because any or all of the checkbox field options can be selected, each option is treated as a separate field that is either checked or unchecked (coded 1 or 0). In your exported dataset you will see that each option has become a separate variable with the number of the option as part of the variable name e.g. color(1), color(2), color(3). When using options from a checkbox field in a calculation or in branching logic instead of writing “color = 3” for example you need to write “color(3)=1” meaning that option 3 of the variable “color” has been selected.\nHow do I hide a section header field type using branching logic? Section header fields follow the branching logic for all fields until the next section header so to hide a section header all fields until the next section header must also be hidden.\nHow do I format greater than/less than conditions in my branching logic? When using a greater than/less than (&gt;&lt;) condition in branching logic don’t put quotation marks around the value as you normally would when using equal to.\nHow do I test branching logic and calculated fields in my form or survey? To test branching logic or calculated fields enter a test record into your database or survey. These functions do not work on the Preview screen. You can remove all test records when you move to production.\nHow do I add an “other” option in a multiple field question that a participant can write in their answer? To include an “Other” option in a multiple choice question that will allow respondents to write in an answer, add a text field that is only displayed when the Other option is selected. If you want it to appear right next to the “Other” option in the multiple choice question you’ll need to use field embedding. You’ll follow the step above, but then additionally you’ll need to tell REDCap to embed the field with the multiple choice answers—this is done by putting the variable name in { } curly brackets where you want it to appear.\nCan I base a calculated field off another calculated field? If you are using calculated fields, avoid creating second-level calculations, i.e. using the results of a calculation as part of another calculation. These fields will not reliably calculate - even though values may appear in the field onscreen, the field may be blank in your exported dataset. Keep in mind the general recommendation to do calculations as part of analysis and keep only raw data in your REDCap database.\nWhy isn’t my calculation saved? If you add a calculated field after you have collected the data used in the calculation you will need to resave the form containing the calculation to trigger REDCap to perform the calculation and populate the field. To update them all at once, you can go to Data Quality under Applications on the sidebar and run Rule H. It will show all fields where the calculated values don’t match what is saved and give you the option to update them all.\nCan I display an image in my form or survey? To display an image on your data entry form or survey use the descriptive text field type which has a field upload feature. For more information please see Formatting REDCap Forms with HTML.\nCan I customize the appearance of my form or survey? REDCap allows some customization of form appearance using HTML code. These include font size, font color, and spacing/indentation of field label text.\nHow do I set up the event grid in a longitudinal project? When setting up a Longitudinal project event grid, if you are not using the Scheduling module, you don’t need to set specific “days offset” but you still need to enter something to tell REDCap the order of your events. If you leave all zero’s REDCap will put your events in alphabetical order. So you can just put 1, 2, 3, etc. You may also want to use increments of 5’s in case you later need to insert a new event.\nWhat happens if I accidently delete an event? In a Longitudinal Model database if you accidentally delete an event your data will not be lost just hidden. When you restore the event with the assigned forms the data will also be restored.\nCan I change the coding of my fields while in production? Although you can make changes to your project fields after moving your project to Production, keep in mind that changes to coding for categorical fields will impact your existing data. For example if you have a field with Yes/No responses that are coded 10 and you change these to 21 then what was originally coded as Yes will now be No - since you have changed the meaning of the value 1.\nHow do I test my database before moving to production? It’s a good idea to test your database or survey before moving to Production by entering a few records of either real or fake data. When moving to Production you can choose to keep or delete these records.\nHow do I review the changes I have made before submitting? Before submitting post-production changes for review, you can see whether they will cause any problems by selecting the “view a detailed summary of all drafted changes” link located next to the Submit Changes for Review button.\nWill I lose data if submitting changes while in production? Project changes made after moving to production must be reviewed prior to being implemented to reduce the risk of data corruption due to a change. However, if you make a change that cannot possibly impact existing data (e.g. create a new field), once you submit the change for approval it will be approved automatically - you won’t have to wait for manual review and approval by the administrator. To view whether you changes create potential issues while you’re in draft mode, go to the “view a detailed summary of all drafted changes” link.\nWhat should I do if I need to make significant changes while in production? If your project is in production and you need to make several changes, consider making a copy of the project (which will be in development), making the changes there, then using the data dictionary to implement the changes all at once in the production project. Alternatively, you can ask the REDCap administrator to move your project back to development.\nHow do I combine my instruments into a single survey? If you have multiple instruments that you want to send out as a single survey, combine them onto a single REDCap form. You can insert page breaks between instruments using the Section Header field type.\nHow do I hide calculated fields in a survey? If you are including survey responses in a calculation but don’t want the respondent to see the calculations, create a separate data entry form and put the calculation fields there. The calculations will be triggered when the survey is submitted.\nHow do I schedule a survey to be sent at a specific date/time? Using the “automated invitations” feature you can schedule survey to be sent at a specific date/time as well as based on a specific response to a previous form or survey. See detailed instructions on how to do this in the Help/FAQ page.\nHow can I set up surveys to go out automatically? If you are using online surveys, you can schedule them to be sent automatically at certain dates or based on specified conditions being met. See Automated Invitations in the Online Designer for instructions.\nHow do I personalize an email invitation? REDCap allows you to customize field labels or survey invitations using “piping”. This means you can insert the response to one field e.g. first name into the label of another field or into a survey invitation text. To do this just put the variable name in square brackets where you want the customized text. For example if the\n\nrespondent’s first name is in a variable called “fname” you can add it to the label of another field like this: [fname] what is your favorite color? Similarly, when you write a survey invitation you can use: Dear [fname], please complete the attached survey. Whatever name has been entered in the field fname will appear in place of the variable name.\n\nHow do I track survey responses? You can track who has responded to a survey by using the Participant List option. In addition, you can identify individual responses using the Participant Identifier feature. Both of these options are found in the Manage Survey Participants section of your project.\nCan I add or delete a survey response? It is possible to edit or delete survey responses. To do this, check the Edit Surveys option in the User Rights section.\nHow do I verify if a survey respondent changed their answers? If you are concerned that survey respondents changed their answers before submitting their survey e.g. to try to qualify for a study you can check their responses in the Logging Tool.\nWhat is the logging tool? You can use the logging tool to troubleshoot issues that arise that may be due to a change in a data value, calculations and branching logic no longer working, etc. In the log you can filter by record, user, and event type."

    "text": "Double Data Entry: Learn how to use REDCap’s Double Data Entry module (video)\nMobile App Guide (user guide)\nMulti-Language Management Manual (user guide)\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I add users to my project? Anyone creating projects should attend a tutorial (see schedule on Tutorials page) which focuses on project creation and REDCap use policies. If you have attended a\n\ntutorial you can request limited accounts for others who will not be designing/managing projects but only doing data entry, data export, etc. To request an account email the REDCap administrator with the person’s name and work email address. By doing this you are also taking responsibility for training them.\n\nWhy is the Participant ID the first field in the project? When you set up a REDCap database your record identifier e.g. Participant ID must be the first field on the first form so that REDCap will link all following data on all forms for that record. There is no need to repeat the record identifier in each form.\nHow do I code categorical variables? If your categorical variable has numeric response options be sure to assign a value that is the same number to avoid confusion in analysis. For example if the question is “How many times did you ….” and the options are 0,1,2,3,4,5 you should assign values of 0-5 (note: you cannot use the auto-assign feature of REDCap because it will start with 1).\nWhen should I use the dropdown field type? Use dropdown field types instead of radio buttons for categorical variables on your data entry forms. REDCap allows you to type the first character of a label to select that option in a dropdown which is much easier than having to individually select each radio button with your mouse.\nHow do I tell the difference between a radio and checkbox field? There is a visual cue to tell you whether a field is a radio button (single option) or a checkbox (choose all that apply). Radio buttons are round, checkboxes are square.\nHow do I format branching logic or a calculation with checkbox fields? Checkbox or “choose all that apply” fields are coded slightly differently from other categorical fields such as radio or dropdown. In those each option is set to equal a unique value e.g. 1=red, 2=blue, 3=green. Because any or all of the checkbox field options can be selected, each option is treated as a separate field that is either checked or unchecked (coded 1 or 0). In your exported dataset you will see that each option has become a separate variable with the number of the option as part of the variable name e.g. color(1), color(2), color(3). When using options from a checkbox field in a calculation or in branching logic instead of writing “color = 3” for example you need to write “color(3)=1” meaning that option 3 of the variable “color” has been selected.\nHow do I hide a section header field type using branching logic? Section header fields follow the branching logic for all fields until the next section header so to hide a section header all fields until the next section header must also be hidden.\nHow do I format greater than/less than conditions in my branching logic? When using a greater than/less than (&gt;&lt;) condition in branching logic don’t put quotation marks around the value as you normally would when using equal to.\nHow do I test branching logic and calculated fields in my form or survey? To test branching logic or calculated fields enter a test record into your database or survey. These functions do not work on the Preview screen. You can remove all test records when you move to production.\nHow do I add an “other” option in a multiple field question that a participant can write in their answer? To include an “Other” option in a multiple choice question that will allow respondents to write in an answer, add a text field that is only displayed when the Other option is selected. If you want it to appear right next to the “Other” option in the multiple choice question you’ll need to use field embedding. You’ll follow the step above, but then additionally you’ll need to tell REDCap to embed the field with the multiple choice answers—this is done by putting the variable name in { } curly brackets where you want it to appear.\nCan I base a calculated field off another calculated field? If you are using calculated fields, avoid creating second-level calculations, i.e. using the results of a calculation as part of another calculation. These fields will not reliably calculate - even though values may appear in the field onscreen, the field may be blank in your exported dataset. Keep in mind the general recommendation to do calculations as part of analysis and keep only raw data in your REDCap database.\nWhy isn’t my calculation saved? If you add a calculated field after you have collected the data used in the calculation you will need to resave the form containing the calculation to trigger REDCap to perform the calculation and populate the field. To update them all at once, you can go to Data Quality under Applications on the sidebar and run Rule H. It will show all fields where the calculated values don’t match what is saved and give you the option to update them all.\nCan I display an image in my form or survey? To display an image on your data entry form or survey use the descriptive text field type which has a field upload feature. For more information please see Formatting REDCap Forms with HTML.\nCan I customize the appearance of my form or survey? REDCap allows some customization of form appearance using HTML code. These include font size, font color, and spacing/indentation of field label text.\nHow do I set up the event grid in a longitudinal project? When setting up a Longitudinal project event grid, if you are not using the Scheduling module, you don’t need to set specific “days offset” but you still need to enter something to tell REDCap the order of your events. If you leave all zero’s REDCap will put your events in alphabetical order. So you can just put 1, 2, 3, etc. You may also want to use increments of 5’s in case you later need to insert a new event.\nWhat happens if I accidently delete an event? In a Longitudinal Model database if you accidentally delete an event your data will not be lost just hidden. When you restore the event with the assigned forms the data will also be restored.\nCan I change the coding of my fields while in production? Although you can make changes to your project fields after moving your project to Production, keep in mind that changes to coding for categorical fields will impact your existing data. For example if you have a field with Yes/No responses that are coded 10 and you change these to 21 then what was originally coded as Yes will now be No - since you have changed the meaning of the value 1.\nHow do I test my database before moving to production? It’s a good idea to test your database or survey before moving to Production by entering a few records of either real or fake data. When moving to Production you can choose to keep or delete these records.\nHow do I review the changes I have made before submitting? Before submitting post-production changes for review, you can see whether they will cause any problems by selecting the “view a detailed summary of all drafted changes” link located next to the Submit Changes for Review button.\nWill I lose data if submitting changes while in production? Project changes made after moving to production must be reviewed prior to being implemented to reduce the risk of data corruption due to a change. However, if you make a change that cannot possibly impact existing data (e.g. create a new field), once you submit the change for approval it will be approved automatically - you won’t have to wait for manual review and approval by the administrator. To view whether you changes create potential issues while you’re in draft mode, go to the “view a detailed summary of all drafted changes” link.\nWhat should I do if I need to make significant changes while in production? If your project is in production and you need to make several changes, consider making a copy of the project (which will be in development), making the changes there, then using the data dictionary to implement the changes all at once in the production project. Alternatively, you can ask the REDCap administrator to move your project back to development.\nHow do I combine my instruments into a single survey? If you have multiple instruments that you want to send out as a single survey, combine them onto a single REDCap form. You can insert page breaks between instruments using the Section Header field type.\nHow do I hide calculated fields in a survey? If you are including survey responses in a calculation but don’t want the respondent to see the calculations, create a separate data entry form and put the calculation fields there. The calculations will be triggered when the survey is submitted.\nHow do I schedule a survey to be sent at a specific date/time? Using the “automated invitations” feature you can schedule survey to be sent at a specific date/time as well as based on a specific response to a previous form or survey. See detailed instructions on how to do this in the Help/FAQ page.\nHow can I set up surveys to go out automatically? If you are using online surveys, you can schedule them to be sent automatically at certain dates or based on specified conditions being met. See Automated Invitations in the Online Designer for instructions.\nHow do I personalize an email invitation? REDCap allows you to customize field labels or survey invitations using “piping”. This means you can insert the response to one field e.g. first name into the label of another field or into a survey invitation text. To do this just put the variable name in square brackets where you want the customized text. For example if the\n\nrespondent’s first name is in a variable called “fname” you can add it to the label of another field like this: [fname] what is your favorite color? Similarly, when you write a survey invitation you can use: Dear [fname], please complete the attached survey. Whatever name has been entered in the field fname will appear in place of the variable name.\n\nHow do I track survey responses? You can track who has responded to a survey by using the Participant List option. In addition, you can identify individual responses using the Participant Identifier feature. Both of these options are found in the Manage Survey Participants section of your project.\nCan I add or delete a survey response? It is possible to edit or delete survey responses. To do this, check the Edit Surveys option in the User Rights section.\nHow do I verify if a survey respondent changed their answers? If you are concerned that survey respondents changed their answers before submitting their survey e.g. to try to qualify for a study you can check their responses in the Logging Tool.\nWhat is the logging tool? You can use the logging tool to troubleshoot issues that arise that may be due to a change in a data value, calculations and branching logic no longer working, etc. In the log you can filter by record, user, and event type."
