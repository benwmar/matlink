    "text": "Introduction\nThe goals of OMOP are to gain better understanding of human health by improving our ability to analyze observational health data.\nHealth data is stored by individual health systems in unique ways which limits the ability to collaborate and learn from larger populations. This is a problem because certain clinical conditions are infrequent and it is important to have sufficient number of cases to perform statistical tests. De-identified data shared across institutions has the promise of allowing scientists to develop important insights about health which is the motivation to enable greater collaboration.\n\nWhat is a common data model?\nA common data model (CDM) allows multiple health care systems with their individual databases to join forces creating greater populations which can power more compelling scientific studies. A simple way to think about this is the difficulty of finding the silverware drawer in a new kitchen – if there is a unifying rule for where the silverware drawer is located in every kitchen (immediately to right of the sink) it makes it possible to find this much easier. A common data model creates a system so that data elements like “systolic blood pressure” or “sepsis” are recorded and organized in the same way. OMOP stands for Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership and is the common data model of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics program.\n\n\nWhat is an ETL?\nETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. Essentially this is the process of mapping data from one system to another. Please see [The Book of OHDSI, Chapter 6] (https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/ExtractTransformLoad.html)."

    "section": "OMOP Table and Field Basics",
    "text": "OMOP Table and Field Basics\nAdapted from OHDSI CDM Site: Data Model Conventions\n\nTables\nFor the tables of the main domains of the CDM it is imperative that concepts used are strictly limited to the domain. For example, the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE table contains only information about conditions (diagnoses, signs, symptoms), but no information about procedures. Not all source coding schemes adhere to such rules. For example, ICD-9-CM codes, which contain mostly diagnoses of human disease, also contain information about the status of patients having received a procedure. The ICD-9-CM code V20.3 ‘Newborn health supervision’ defines a continuous procedure and is therefore stored in the PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE table.\n\n\nFields\nVariable names across all tables follow one convention:\n\n\n\nNotation\nDescription\n\n\n_SOURCE_VALUE\nVerbatim information from the source data, typically used in ETL to map to CONCEPT_ID, and not to be used by any standard analytics. For example, CONDITION_SOURCE_VALUE = ‘787.02’ was the ICD-9 code captured as a diagnosis from the administrative claim.\n\n\n_ID\nUnique identifiers for key entities, which can serve as foreign keys to establish relationships across entities. For example, PERSON_ID uniquely identifies each individual. VISIT_OCCURRENCE_ID uniquely identifies a PERSON encounter at a point of care.\n\n\n_CONCEPT_ID\nForeign key into the Standardized Vocabularies (i.e. the standard_concept attribute for the corresponding term is true), which serves as the primary basis for all standardized analytics. For example, CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID = 31967 contains the reference value for the SNOMED concept of ‘Nausea’\n\n\n_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID\nForeign key into the Standardized Vocabularies representing the concept and terminology used in the source data, when applicable. For example, CONDITION_SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID = 45431665 denotes the concept of ‘Nausea’ in the Read terminology; the analogous CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID might be 31967, since SNOMED-CT is the Standardized Vocabulary for most clinical diagnoses and findings.\n\n\n_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID\nDelineates the origin of the source information, standardized within the Standardized Vocabularies. For example, DRUG_TYPE_CONCEPT_ID can allow analysts to discriminate between ‘Pharmacy dispensing’ and ’Prescription written\n\n\n\nFor more information, see:\nData Model Conventions\nHow to Calculate Drug Dose\nClinical Data Tables"
